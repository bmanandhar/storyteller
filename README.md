### Overview:

* This group-project has been developed as a part that is required to graduate the WDI49 course at GA(San Francisco). Group includes *Bijaya Manandhar, Ujwol Rai and Jay Ortiz* who worked for a week to get it ready starting from scratch.

* The isdea of using this web-app is to create data-base from two different groups of users. 

  * Author or writer: Who are interested in writing stories (or any literary article) and present to readers in the web. They can recieve the comments readers will post.

  * Readers: We have catogorised readers into three subgroups:

    1. Readers who simply visit website and enjoy reading the posted aricles.

    2. Readers who sign-up and read the articles posted. They (if wish) can post their views on the article they read using comment form. 

    3. The users who posted articles or comments have acces to edit/delete their respective posts. Similarly Author group has access to delete the comments they received, no edit.

* The product can still be enlarged so as to include option for authors, such as catagrize the articles received that may be story, travel-blog, poems etc. 

* We can proudly present the work to the potential employers, friends and family members. 

* This project has been a very good school for us to learn the Django framework in developing a web app and deploying on heroku platform. 

* We now have good knowledge how url's, file-system, templating language work in case of Django framework using Pyhton programing language.

* It is an outcome that the group achieved with great help from instructors **Isha Arora** and **Dalton Hart** who never got tired answering any question we had and solving out issues that came up as hurdles in writing code to complete this project.
