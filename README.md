# Overview:

* This group-project has been developed as a part that is required to graduate the WDI49 course at GA(San Francisco). Group includes *Bijaya Manandhar, Ujwol Rai and Jay Ortiz* who worked for a week to get it ready starting from scratch.

* The idea behind this application is to create a blog where people can share their story, we have grouped the users in two basic catogories as below.

  * Author: Who are interested in writing stories (or any literary article) and present to readers in the web. They can recieve the comments readers having login credentials will post. Author can delete comments on his/her own posts/articles.
        
  * Reader : Readers are the users who may or may not have login credentials. They can read all the posts including comments. To make comment readers must have login credentials. They can also edit or delete own comments.

* The product can still be enlarged so as to include option for authors, such as categorzie the articles received that may be story, travel-blog, poems etc. 

* We can proudly present the work to the potential employers, friends and family members. 

* Working on this project has been one of the best practices that we ever had in the django framework. 

* We now have the knowledge of python ,prostgresql, Django framework .

* It is an outcome that the group achieved with great help from instructors **Isha Arora** and **Dalton Hart** who never got tired answering any questions we had and solving issues that came up as hurdles in writing code to complete this project.
