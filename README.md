# Overview:

* This group-project has been developed as a part that is required to graduate the WDI49 course at GA(San Francisco). Group includes *Bijaya Manandhar, Ujwol Rai and Jay Ortiz* who worked for a week to get it ready starting from scratch.

* The idea behind this application is to create a blog where people can share their story 

  * Author: Who are interested in writing stories (or any literary article) and present to readers in the web. They can recieve the comments readers will post but they need to login or have login credentials. Author can delete comments on his own post/article
        
  * Reader : Reader are the users who may or maynot have login credentials. They can read all the post/story but can't  comment. To make comment user must have login credentials

* The product can still be enlarged so as to include option for authors, such as categorzie the articles received that may be story, travel-blog, poems etc. 

* We can proudly present the work to the potential employers, friends and family members. 

* Doing this project would be one of the best practices in the django framework. 

* We now have the knowledge of python ,prostgresql, Django framework .

* It is an outcome that the group achieved with great help from instructors **Isha Arora** and **Dalton Hart** who never got tired answering any questions we had and solving issues that came up as hurdles in writing code to complete this project.
